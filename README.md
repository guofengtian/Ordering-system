# Ordering-system
When people open the website, they can choose the dishes they want. After they order their meal successfully, the system will generate an order for them, and the dishes' number will decrease. In that case, operators of the restaurant must replenish as soon as possible. 
All of the dishes' information is saved in a database. Only the operators can change the data. For example, add quantity or change price.
